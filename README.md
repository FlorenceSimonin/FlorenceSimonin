### ✍️ About me
I'm currently on a bootcamp course at the Wild Code School, and my plan is to change career direction and become a DATA ANALYST.

During 4 years with PRECOR France, an American fitness brand, where I started in customer service, I was entrusted with other tasks over the years, making my job more diversified.
I was thus able to demonstrate my skills in management, logistics, finance and in supporting the after-sales service to structure the department.

Following a skills assessment, I was able to validate my project, and I'm ready to take on the challenges of the Data world, 
to continually learn, and play an active role in problem-solving through in-depth data analysis.
